description: How to USE the GridGain demo data generator — authoring ops.yaml/data.yaml, choosing rate kinds, transaction_scope, distribution (multi-pod), provisioning, live metrics, runtime rate control, and stopping a run cleanly. Use when configuring or running a data-generator scenario, debugging generator throughput/errors, driving load up/down at runtime, running a scenario until an operator stops it, deciding how to load a GridGain cluster, or editing ops.yaml/data.yaml.

# GridGain Demo Data Generator — Usage

*Last updated: 2026-09-30*

A YAML-configured streaming data generator for GridGain 8/9 clusters. It is a **standalone** component (consumed by the plugin and the demo UI, but depends on neither). This skill is the usage contract: the config surface and the semantics that bite. It does **not** describe how any particular consumer launches it — for the gradle plugin's `dataGenerate` dispatch, see the `gridgain-demo-toolkit` skill.

> **Verify before asserting.** Flags, enum values and version numbers drift. The config-file *shape* below is the stable contract; cite the source files in §Sources when a fact must be exact, and re-check against them. Keep the *Last updated* date current when you change this file.

## Two config files

| File | Purpose | Current schema_version |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| `ops.yaml` | scenarios (rate/duration/scope/concurrency/**operations/warmup/key_space**), metrics, control, otel | **10** |
| `data.yaml` | schemas → columns → value sources, FK relations, **replication** | **3** |

Both carry a `schema_version` and are **auto-migrated** forward before validation (`OpsConfigMigrationRunner`, `DataConfigMigrationRunner`). Validation failures are fatal with remediation text.

## ops.yaml

```yaml
schema_version: 10
metrics:                       # optional — live throughput/latency to Kafka (§Metrics)

    kind: element
    name: payments-bus               # a `message_brokers` entry in the toolkit's demo-config.yaml

    kind: address

      put: 0.80

      put_get: 0.0             # a get AND a put on ONE key, counted as one operation
    warmup: { kind: none }     # required from v10 — none | time | count (§Benchmark-shaped runs)
    key_space: { kind: unbounded }   # required from v10 — unbounded | bounded (§Benchmark-shaped runs)
    transaction_scope: none    # none | business_event (see gotcha)
    provisioning: skip         # skip | emit | apply
    distribution:              # optional — multi-pod (see gotcha)
      replicas: 4
      partition_count: 16
```

**A scenario names no cluster.** It describes a *load shape* only, which is what makes one ops file portable across demos. The cluster comes from `--target-cluster <name>` at launch (§CLI), resolved against the client-endpoints file. Before v7 a top-level `targets:` array declared `{name, kind, cluster_name}` and each scenario carried a `target:` naming one; `MigrateOpsV6toV7` strips both (§Gotchas). The `kind` discriminator went with them — it was never information the entry point lacked, since `Gg8Main`/`Gg9Main` each serve exactly one flavour.

**`rate` kinds:** `constant` (`ops_per_second`) · `ramped` (`from`, `to`, `over: <ISO-8601>`) · `stepped` (`steps: [{rate, hold: <ISO-8601>}]`, holds final rate after the last step).

**`duration` kinds:** `time` (`value: <ISO-8601>`) · `count` (`value: <int>` ops) · `until_stop_condition` (paired with `stop_conditions[]`).

**`stop_conditions` kinds** (optional list, ORed, evaluated after each op): `latency_p99_above` / `latency_p999_above` (`threshold: <ISO-8601>`) · `error_rate_above` (`threshold: 0.0–1.0`) · `external_signal` (no fields). A triggered stop is the run's outcome, not a crash — it lands in `result.yaml`'s `stop_reason`.

**`external_signal` is what makes "run until stopped" real.** It declares that the scenario is *intentionally* unbounded and ends when an operator says so, delivered as a `stop` command on the control channel (§Runtime control):

```yaml
control:
  broker: { kind: element, name: payments-bus }
  topic: "datagen-control"
scenarios:
  - name: run-until-stopped
    root_schemas: [customer]
    rate: { kind: constant, ops_per_second: 1000 }
    duration: { kind: until_stop_condition }
    concurrency: 32
    stop_conditions:
      - { kind: external_signal }
    operations: { put: 1.0, get: 0.0, put_get: 0.0 }
    warmup: { kind: none }
    key_space: { kind: unbounded }
```

- **It requires a top-level `control:` block.** Without one nothing can raise the signal, so the run would be unbounded and unstoppable short of a SIGTERM. `ExternalSignalControlValidator` fails the parse naming the scenario and the block to add.
- **`external_signal` also lifts the internal safety cap** on `until_stop_condition`, which otherwise bounds such a run at one minute. Declaring the condition is the opt-in to a genuinely unbounded run; nothing else lifts the cap.
- The threshold conditions only start judging after 100 operations (too few samples make a percentile meaningless). `external_signal` is checked *ahead* of that gate — an operator pressing stop is not a statistic, and at a low rate the 100th op could be minutes away.
- `until_stop_condition` with **no** `stop_conditions` at all is not rejected — nothing rejected it before either — but it now logs a config warning, because nothing decides when such a run ends and it just runs into the one-minute cap.

**`provisioning`:** `skip` (caches/tables must already exist — the norm when something else owns the schema) · `emit` (write cache XML / DDL to the output dir, don't apply) · `apply` (create absent caches/tables).

## Benchmark-shaped runs (v10+)

Three keys turn a scenario from a data stream into something whose numbers mean something. All are
**required** from v10; `MigrateOpsV9toV10` writes the pre-v10 behaviour into every existing scenario,
so an upgraded file runs exactly the workload it ran before.

### `operations` — replaces `read_ratio`

```yaml
operations: { put: 0.0, get: 0.0, put_get: 1.0 }   # must sum to 1.0 (checked at parse, ±0.001)
```

`put_get` is a get **and** a put against **one key**, counted as a single operation — the
read-modify-write a real application performs, and what Yardstick's `PutGetBenchmark` measures. It
is not the same as interleaving independent gets and puts, which is all `read_ratio` could ever
express: the pair touches one partition twice in succession and its latency is both round trips.

⚠️ A target that cannot read, paired with a nonzero `get` or `put_get` weight, silently becomes 100%
puts. Carried forward unchanged from `read_ratio`.

### `warmup` — operations performed but not measured

```yaml
warmup: { kind: none }                 # measure from the first operation (pre-v10 behaviour)
warmup: { kind: time,  value: "PT60S" }
warmup: { kind: count, value: 1000 }
```

Warmup operations still run, still hit the target and still populate the key space — a benchmark
that skips them measures a cluster in a state no application ever sees. What they do not do is enter
the measurement: `achieved_rate`, `measured_operations`, `measured_window` and every
`latency_*_ms` describe the post-warmup window alone. `wall_time` remains the whole run.

Before v10 every figure included the JVM interpreting before it compiled, the client opening its
connections and discovering the topology, and the cluster's pages not yet resident. **The shorter the
run, the more that dominated** — backwards from what a quick sanity run should report.

A `count` warmup can overshoot by up to `concurrency - 1`, for the same reason
`duration: {kind: count}` can.

### `key_space` — the domain of keys the scenario addresses

```yaml
key_space: { kind: unbounded }                                        # pre-v10 behaviour
key_space: { kind: bounded, size: 1000000, distribution: uniform }    # Yardstick's -r/--range
```

| distribution | shape | use |
|---|---|---|
| `uniform` | every key equally likely | the honest default, and a cache's **worst** case |
| `zipfian` | hot head, long cold tail | how real access patterns look; makes caching look good |
| `latest` | skewed to the most recently written keys | a feed, a ledger tail, an event stream — the hot set moves with the write cursor, so the cache constantly re-warms |

**Bounded mode is what makes a run repeatable and a get able to hit.** Unbounded, write keys come
from the key column's `value_source` and reads sample only what *this process* wrote during *this
run*, so no two runs address the same rows.

Three consequences, all deliberate:

1. **It supersedes the key column's `value_source`**, which must therefore be a `sequence` — index
   `i` becomes `start + i*step`. Any other source is **refused at construction** with a message
   naming the column, because a bound that could only be honoured on one half of a put/get pair
   would produce a run that looks bounded and is not.
2. **Writes overwrite**, by construction. That is what a put benchmark measures. The per-worker key
   striping that prevents duplicate PKs in unbounded mode does not apply, and every instance of a
   fleet addresses the same space — correct for a benchmark, where all drivers hit one range.
3. **A get-only run must be preceded by a put run.** Nothing pre-populates the space. Check
   `read_miss_count`.

### What `result.yaml` now reports

```yaml
scenario_name: "put-benchmark"
achieved_rate: 48213.7          # operations/sec over the MEASURED window
error_count: 0
success_count: 300000
read_miss_count: 0              # reads that succeeded and found nothing — check before quoting reads
rows_written: 300000
rows_per_write: 1.0             # fan-out: 1.0 means one operation was exactly one put
stop_reason: "time elapsed"
wall_time: "PT6M"               # whole run, warmup included
measured_operations: 250000
measured_window: "PT5M"         # what achieved_rate and the percentiles describe
latency_p50_ms: 0.41
latency_p90_ms: 0.88
latency_p99_ms: 2.15
latency_max_ms: 61.02
latency_mean_ms: 0.52
```

⚠️ **`rows_per_write` is the one to read first when comparing two runs.** One operation is one
*business event*, which a `data.yaml` with `parent-fk-ref` children turns into several row writes
across several caches — so `achieved_rate` counts events, not puts. A benchmark-shaped `data.yaml`
has **one schema and no `parent-fk-ref`**, which gives exactly `1.0`; anything higher and the two
runs are measuring different amounts of cluster work.

## Concurrency (v8+)

`concurrency` is how many **worker threads one generator process runs**. It is required from v8; `MigrateOpsV7toV8` writes `1` into every migrated scenario, so an upgraded file behaves exactly as it did before.

**This is the setting that decides whether you can load a cluster at all.** Before v8 a run was one JVM with a single emitting thread, so its ceiling was the reciprocal of the target's round-trip latency, *not* whatever `rate` asked for — against a 200 µs round trip one thread tops out near 5,000 ops/s and a `rate` of 1,000,000 simply never throttles. The only way to add load was to launch more processes. With `concurrency: N` the process holds N operations in flight.

```yaml
scenarios:
  - name: max-write
    root_schemas: [customer]
    rate: { kind: constant, ops_per_second: 1000000 }   # effectively unlimited
    duration: { kind: until_stop_condition }
    concurrency: 64
    stop_conditions: [{ kind: external_signal }]
    operations: { put: 1.0, get: 0.0, put_get: 0.0 }
    warmup: { kind: none }
    key_space: { kind: unbounded }
```

- **`rate` stays a per-process target shared by the workers, not per thread.** `concurrency: 64` with `ops_per_second: 1000` is still 1000 ops/s for the process; the threads take turns. Raise `rate` too, or it becomes the bottleneck instead of the cluster.
- **`set_rate`'s `targetTpsPerInstance` likewise addresses the whole process**, not each thread.
- **Every process in a fleet must use the same `concurrency`.** Each worker takes a slice of the key space computed from it (`workerStripe`), so a 1-thread and a 4-thread process in one fleet produce stripes of different widths that **overlap and write duplicate primary keys**. Uniformity holds automatically when all instances launch from the same ops.yaml — take care if you ever hand-edit one.
- It composes with `--instance-index`/`--instance-count` and with Kubernetes distributed mode: worker `w` of process stripe `(i, n)` owns stripe `(i*C + w, n*C)`, so M machines × C threads tile the key space exactly.
- **Sizing:** start at roughly the number of vCPUs on the client machine and raise it until server CPU stops climbing. Client threads are mostly blocked on the network, so a client can usefully run many more threads than it has cores; the right value is the one where the *cluster* saturates before the client does.
- `concurrency: 1` is not merely equivalent to the old behaviour, it *is* the old behaviour: the runner spawns no threads and runs the loop on the calling thread.

## Broker references (v9+)

`metrics:` and `control:` no longer carry a `kafka_bootstrap` address. Each takes a `broker:` with
a `kind` discriminator, and the two forms are **disjoint configurations, not a value with a
fallback** — the document says which it means and the generator never guesses:

| form | when | resolved |
|---|---|---|
| `{ kind: element, name: <n> }` | the demo toolkit deployed the broker | at launch, from `broker-endpoints.yaml` (`--broker-endpoints`) |
| `{ kind: address, bootstrap_servers: <host:port> }` | a broker this demo does **not** own — a laptop, a lab broker, a managed service | used verbatim; needs no endpoints file |

**Why.** A v8 address was a hand-copied duplicate of something the toolkit already knew, and it
went stale silently when a broker was redeployed elsewhere. A name is resolved per run, so there
is one definition of where the broker is.

**The address form is load-bearing, not symmetry.** The generator must not depend on the plugin;
without it a standalone run could not use `metrics:`/`control:` at all.

**Resolution is eager**, in `ScenarioRunnerCli.resolve()` — before the target is connected and
before any row is written. A named broker that is configured but **not deployed** does not appear
in `broker-endpoints.yaml`, so the run fails at launch naming the broker, what the file does
declare, and both remedies. It never silently disables the channel, which would look exactly like
a working demo that happens to report nothing.

## data.yaml

```yaml
schema_version: 3            # current; a v1/v2 file is migrated forward automatically
schemas:
  - name: customer            # maps 1:1 to a GG cache/table name (see gotcha)
    update_ratio: 0.05        # fraction of WRITES that reuse an existing key vs insert a new one.
                              # NOT a read/write mix — that is `operations` in ops.yaml. At any value
                              # every operation this controls is still a put.
    backups: 1                 # required from v3
    write_synchronization_mode: full_sync   # required from v3
    columns:
      - name: id
        key: true             # exactly one key column per schema
        null_rate: 0.0
        value_source: { kind: sequence, start: 1, step: 1 }
      - name: first_name
        null_rate: 0.0
        value_source: { kind: datafaker, expression: "#{name.firstName}" }
  - name: account
    update_ratio: 0.0
    columns:
      - name: id
        key: true
        null_rate: 0.0
        value_source: { kind: sequence, start: 1, step: 1 }
      - name: customer_id
        affinity: true        # colocation key (GG8 affinityKey / GG9 COLOCATE BY)
        null_rate: 0.0         # parent-fk-ref columns must NOT have null_rate > 0
        value_source:
          kind: parent-fk-ref
          parent_schema: customer
          parent_column: id
          cohort_buckets:      # heavy-tail: 10% of parents get 100 children, 90% get 1
            - { share: 0.10, multiplier: 100 }
            - { share: 0.90, multiplier: 1 }
```

**`value_source` kinds** (authoritative list in the data JSONSchema): `sequence` · `datafaker` (DataFaker `expression`) · `unique` (unique-within-run) · `weighted-choice` (`choices: [{value, weight}]`) · `yaml-data` (`path`, `key` — static fixture list) · `parent-fk-ref` (FK relation + `cohort_buckets`) · `key-suffix` (`base_column`, `separator`, `length`).

## Gotchas (the ones that cost time)

1. **`transaction_scope: business_event` requires TRANSACTIONAL caches.** It wraps a root emission + its children in one transaction. GG8 8.9+ **rejects atomic-cache operations inside a transaction**, so against ATOMIC caches (the GG8 `CREATE TABLE` default) every write rolls back — shows up as a high error rate (`op_errors`, `TargetReportedFailure`). Use `transaction_scope: none` unless every target cache is TRANSACTIONAL. Source: `Gg8KvTarget`.
2. **Multi-pod rate is NOT divided across pods** (verified empirically 2026-06-15). With `distribution.replicas = N` and `rate.ops_per_second = R`, **each pod runs at R**, so total ≈ R × N. To hit a *total* target T across N pods, set `ops_per_second = ceil(T / N)`. (The code carries a "future work: divide rate across workers" intent — until that lands, treat rate as per-pod.)
3. **`partition_count >= replicas`** is required (`DistributionValidator`). Distribution uses a Coordinator (k8s Lease + ConfigMap leader election) and only activates when `POD_NAME`/`POD_NAMESPACE` are set (downward API); local runs fall back to single-pod.
4. **Schema name = cache name.** A `data.yaml` schema named `account` writes to a GG cache/table literally named `account` — **not** `SQL_PUBLIC_ACCOUNT`. If a consumer reads from SQL-created `SQL_PUBLIC_*` caches, generator load won't appear there unless the schema names and key/value shapes are aligned to those caches.
5. **Durations are ISO-8601** (`java.time.Duration`): `PT10M`, not `10m` (`DateTimeParseException`).
6. **~~Single-thread per pod.~~ Fixed in v8 — set `concurrency`.** Until v8 one process ran one emitting thread, so it was bounded by GG round-trip latency and raising `ops_per_second` alone plateaued; the only remedy was more processes or pods. A scenario's `concurrency` (§Concurrency) now sets worker threads per process, which is the first knob to reach for when a run will not load the cluster. Raise `rate` alongside it — the workers share one per-process rate, so an unchanged `rate` just becomes the new bottleneck.
7. **ops `schema_version: 6` needs a generator built at or after 2026-08-18.** v6 makes `histogram_highest_ms` and `histogram_significant_digits` required inside `metrics:`. An older archive refuses the file outright ("only supports up to schema_version 5"), and a newer generator refuses a v6 `metrics:` block that omits either key. `MigrateOpsV5toV6` fills both in automatically — but it rewrites the file through SnakeYAML and **drops every comment**, so a hand-commented `ops.yaml` should be hand-edited instead. `histogram_significant_digits` is capped at 4: cost is ~100x per extra digit, and 5 would mean ~21 MB/sec of allocation per instance.
8. **ops `schema_version: 7` invalidates every deployed generator archive.** v7 removes `targets:` and `scenario.target`; the cluster arrives as the required `--target-cluster` flag instead. The two directions both fail: a pre-v7 archive refuses a v7 file outright ("only supports up to schema_version 6"), and a v7 archive refuses to start without the flag. So upgrading an ops file is not a config-only change — **every** installed archive and image has to be rebuilt and redeployed alongside it, and any launcher that does not pass `--target-cluster` yet (a systemd unit, a k8s manifest, a script) has to be updated in the same pass. `MigrateOpsV6toV7` migrates the file automatically but rewrites it through SnakeYAML and **drops every comment**, so hand-edit a commented `ops.yaml` instead. It also **cannot** preserve the scenario→cluster wiring — nothing in v7 stores it — so it logs a WARN per scenario naming the cluster it discarded and the flag that now supplies it. Read those warnings before discarding the log; they are the only record of what your launch arguments should be.
9. **SIGTERM is now a clean stop, inside a 10-second budget.** A JVM shutdown hook (registered in `ScenarioRunnerCli.run`, so both `Gg8Main` and `Gg9Main` get it) raises the run's stop signal, lets the **in-flight operation finish**, and then runs the normal end-of-run path: final `active=false` metrics snapshot with whole-run figures and the merged HdrHistogram, target close, `result.yaml`, `state.yaml`. The hook waits up to **10s** for that (`ScenarioRunnerCli.GRACEFUL_STOP_SECONDS`) before letting the JVM halt — a JVM in shutdown halts the moment its hooks return and does *not* wait for other threads, so the wait is what stops the process beating its own cleanup. 10s is sized to sit well inside both deadlines that kill the process: a pod's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (**30s**, the k8s default — the generator's Deployment does not set it) and the host systemd unit's `TimeoutStopSec` (from `host_timeouts.unit_active`, 120s in the shipped template). Overrun that and you get SIGKILL and no final snapshot, i.e. the old behaviour. `stop_reason` reads `stopped by signal: <why>`, distinct from `count reached` / `time elapsed` / `until_stop_condition cap reached` and from a triggered stop condition. Note a **SIGKILL still emits nothing** — the per-tick histogram (§Metrics) remains the fallback.
10. **The control message gained a required `kind`, and the break is silent in both directions.** No ops schema version moves for this (`external_signal` and `control:`'s shape were already in ops v7), so **nothing in the config files tells you the fleet is out of date** — this is a *code* break with no version handshake behind it. A pre-`kind` archive accepts a new `set_rate` (it ignores the unknown `kind` field and finds the three fields it wants) but rejects a `stop` as "missing required field `targetTpsPerInstance`"; a new archive rejects the old undiscriminated payload outright. Either way the failure is a log line on the generator side, so from the sender's seat the rate slider works and the stop button does nothing. **Redeploy every archive and image in the same pass as the sender.**
11. **N processes sharing one `data.yaml` with a `sequence` source all write the same keys.** A `value_source: {kind: sequence, start: 1, step: 1}` starts at `start` in *every* process, so M concurrently launched generators contend on the same entries and the same partitions instead of dividing the key space. **Kubernetes distributed mode does this for you; host and local mode do not** — `Coordinator` derives a per-pod stripe but only activates in-cluster (it needs `POD_NAME`/`POD_NAMESPACE`), so every host and local run got the null stripe. Pass **`--instance-index i` / `--instance-count n`** (§CLI) — index unique per process, `0..n-1` — and each process strides by `n * step` from `start + i * step`, disjoint keys whose union is the single-process sequence.
    - **The symptom is not an error.** Measured on real hardware: 32 processes against a 2-node GG8 cluster settled at **93 ops/s, 498 ms mean latency, zero errors**, while both hosts' CPU was idle, server thread pools sat `active=0, qSize=0`, heap was fine and disk was 5% used. The tell is the data volume: **50M+ operations left 383 MB** in an 8 GB data region, because the writes were overwriting each other. So the diagnostic is "no errors, idle CPU on both sides, and far less data than ops" — nothing in the run's own output, or in the cluster's, reports it.
    - The flags are **optional and both-or-neither**; one without the other is refused naming both. Nothing validates that a fleet used each index exactly once — two processes given the same index write the same keys, which is the original failure with extra steps.
    - Supplying them **in Kubernetes distributed mode is refused**, not merged: the coordinator has already partitioned the key space and two sources of truth for it is the same class of defect. Drop the flags there.
12. **The `target` telemetry attribute now carries a cluster name, not a target alias.** The attribute *name* is unchanged (`target`), so existing queries keep resolving — but a dashboard that groups by it re-labels, showing cluster names where `targets[]` aliases used to appear. Panels keep working; saved queries filtering on a literal alias silently match nothing. This is the same class as the "metrics arrive, Prometheus is healthy, every panel is empty" failure: nothing errors, so only the graph tells you.
13. **ops `schema_version: 8` invalidates every deployed generator archive, like v7 did.** v8 makes `concurrency` required on every scenario. A pre-v8 archive refuses a v8 file outright ("only supports up to schema_version 7"), so **every installed archive and image must be rebuilt and redeployed in the same pass** as the ops file. `MigrateOpsV7toV8` fills `concurrency: 1` automatically but rewrites the file through SnakeYAML and **drops every comment** — hand-edit a commented `ops.yaml` instead. Unlike v6→v7 nothing is lost, so this migration reports nothing.
14. **Mixed `concurrency` across a fleet writes duplicate primary keys.** Each worker's key-space stripe is derived from `concurrency`, so processes that disagree on it produce stripes of different widths that overlap. Symptom is silent overwrites, not an error. Launch every instance of a run from the same ops.yaml.

15. **ops `schema_version: 9` invalidates every deployed generator archive, like v7 and v8 did.** v9 replaces `metrics.kafka_bootstrap` / `control.kafka_bootstrap` with a required `broker:` reference (§Broker references). A pre-v9 archive refuses a v9 file outright ("only supports up to schema_version 8"), so **every installed archive and image must be rebuilt and redeployed in the same pass** as the ops file. ⚠️ **Unlike 7→8, hand-bumping `schema_version` is NOT equivalent to running the migration.** `MigrateOpsV8toV9` performs a real rewrite — `kafka_bootstrap: X` → `broker: { kind: address, bootstrap_servers: X }` — so a hand-bumped file also needs those two keys rewritten by hand, or the v9 JSONSchema rejects it for a missing `broker`. (Hand-editing is still the right move for a heavily-commented ops.yaml: the migration rewrites through SnakeYAML and drops every comment.) The migration deliberately **never invents an element name** from an address — only a deployment knows that `10.0.0.5:9092` is `payments-bus` — so switching a channel to the reference form is always a manual, considered edit.

15a. **ops `schema_version: 10` invalidates every deployed generator archive and image**, as v7,
    v8 and v9 did. v10 removes `read_ratio` and adds three required keys — `operations`, `warmup`,
    `key_space`. A pre-v10 archive refuses a v10 file outright, so **rebuild and redeploy the whole
    fleet in the same pass as the ops file**, not after it. `MigrateOpsV9toV10` does a real rewrite
    (`read_ratio: r` → `operations: {get: r, put: 1-r, put_get: 0}`), so — as with 8→9 — hand-bumping
    the version is **not** equivalent to running the migration: a hand-bumped file also needs the
    three keys written by hand, and v10 sets `additionalProperties: false`, so a surviving
    `read_ratio` is rejected by name rather than ignored.

16. **A get-only run still writes on a cold start — unless the key space is bounded.** In
    `key_space: { kind: unbounded }` the read branch is gated on `keyRegistry.size(rootSchema) > 0`,
    so with an empty registry the first tick falls through to a write, which registers a key, and
    every tick after it reads. With N worker threads racing, up to N writes slip through. Two ways
    out, and the second is the real one:
    - start from a `state.yaml` written by an earlier load run — `ScenarioRunnerCli` restores the
      registry before the first tick, so `size > 0` holds immediately; or
    - **use `key_space: { kind: bounded, … }`**, where keys are computed from the space rather than
      remembered, so there is nothing to warm up and no write ever slips through.

    ⚠️ A bounded get-only run against a space nothing has filled hits **nothing**. That is not an
    error and does not raise `error_count` — check **`read_miss_count`** in `result.yaml` before
    quoting any read figure (§Gotcha 19a). Note also that reads only ever target
    `rootSchemas.first()`.

17. **✅ FIXED 2026-09-30 — the pacing bottleneck that made more processes beat more threads.**
    This entry used to advise preferring processes over threads. That advice was a workaround for
    two defects in the limiter, both now repaired. **Any throughput or in-flight figure recorded
    before this date was measuring the limiter as much as the cluster** — do not compare across it.

    - `ControllableRateLimiter.acquire()` held a **process-wide `ReentrantLock` across the
      delegate's wait** on the no-override path, so every worker queued behind every other. Only the
      override path — reached solely *after* a `set_rate` control command — reserved its slot with a
      CAS and waited outside the lock, which is why a fleet got faster once someone touched the rate
      slider. All four limiters now share `PacingCursor`, which does the CAS everywhere, and the
      lock is gone.
    - The wait itself was `Thread.sleep(millis, nanos)`, which **rounds any sub-millisecond request
      up to a whole millisecond**: measured on JDK 17, `Thread.sleep(0, 500)` takes **1.23 ms**,
      2,400× the request. That capped a waiting thread at roughly **810 ops/s** whatever
      `ops_per_second` said, and is why `ops_per_second: 1000000` never behaved as though it were
      unlimited. `PacingWait` now parks and spins to the deadline (`LockSupport.parkNanos` measured
      3.9 µs for the same 500 ns request).

    Historical record, since it is the evidence: on the Power lab 128 threads in **2** processes
    held only ~50 operations in flight, while the same 128 in **4** processes held 112 and
    throughput rose 29%. Source: `PacingCursor.kt`, `RateLimiter.kt` (`PacingWait`),
    `RateLimiterPacingTest`.

18. **One thin-client connection per server node, per process.** `Gg8KvTarget` builds its
    `ClientConfiguration` with only `setAddressesFinder`, `setTimeout` and
    `setAffinityAwarenessEnabled` — **`setConnectionsPerServer` is never called**, so the default
    applies and every worker thread in a process multiplexes onto one socket per server node. The
    protocol pipelines, so this is not a hard cap on in-flight requests, but it is a shared write
    path and another reason process count matters more than it looks.

19. **✅ FIXED 2026-09-30 — percentiles are now readable in two more places.**
    There used to be exactly one source of a percentile: `runLatencyHistogram` on the Kafka feed, a
    base64 HdrHistogram in **microseconds**, which required a broker to be deployed. That still
    works and is still the live source. Two additions:

    - **`result.yaml` now carries the run's own latency** — `latency_p50_ms`, `latency_p90_ms`,
      `latency_p99_ms`, `latency_max_ms`, `latency_mean_ms`, in **milliseconds**. Always written,
      with or without a `metrics:` block: the histogram was being recorded on every run and read by
      nobody. A run is now quotable from its own results file.
    - **`data_generator_op_latency_nanoseconds_bucket` is queryable.** Its largest finite bucket used
      to be **0.01 ms** — OTel's default millisecond-scale boundaries applied to a value recorded in
      nanoseconds — so every real operation landed in `+Inf` and `histogram_quantile` returned
      nothing. `Instruments.LATENCY_BUCKETS_NANOS` now advises boundaries from 10 µs to 10 s. The
      series keeps its name and unit deliberately, so existing panels keep resolving rather than
      going empty.

    ⚠️ Percentiles do **not** compose. Merging a fleet still means merging the per-instance
    histograms, never averaging their p99s.

19a. **`result.yaml` also carries `read_miss_count`.** A read that succeeded and found nothing used
    to be counted as a plain success, so a run whose every get missed reported a healthy rate and a
    clean error count. Misses are deliberately **not** errors — a sparse key space is not a broken
    cluster — so they are their own number, next to `error_count`, and their own OTel counter
    (`data_generator.op.misses`). **Check it before quoting any read-heavy figure:** a miss ratio
    near 1 means the run measured the cluster's empty path. Until a bounded key space exists, reads
    sample only keys this process wrote this run (or restored from `state.yaml`), so a read-only run
    against a fresh registry is the easy way to produce exactly that.

20. **A missing CLI argument surfaces as a raw stacktrace**, not a usage message:
    `NoSuchElementException: Key --data is missing in the map` at `CliArgs.kt:33`. It names neither
    the option that was expected nor the caller, which is disproportionately confusing when the
    caller is a systemd unit's `ExecStart` or a k8s manifest rather than a shell you can retry in.

21. **`provisioning: apply` creates GG8 caches with statistics ENABLED, and pre-existing caches keep
    whatever they had.** GridGain defaults cache statistics off, which leaves `CachePuts`/`CacheGets`
    — and every monitoring panel reading them — blank however hard the generator drives the cluster.
    Nothing errors and the load is real, so the symptom is an empty graph that reads as a broken
    generator. `Gg8CacheConfig` now sets it. ⚠️ **This only applies at cache CREATION**, like
    `backups` and `write_synchronization_mode`: a cache created before this change, or by anything
    other than the generator, still has statistics off. Destroy it and let provisioning recreate it,
    or toggle statistics at runtime through the cluster API.


## ⚠️ A run can succeed and still lose its completion line

Observed twice on 2026-10-06, both at high write volume over a 4-minute run. The scenario finishes
cleanly — `result.yaml` records `stop_reason: "time elapsed"`, the full measured window, 40.8M
operations and **zero errors** — and then the process dies *afterwards*, while persisting state:

```
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
  at com.gridgain.demo.datagen.scenario.KeyRegistry.snapshot(KeyRegistry.kt:78)
  at com.gridgain.demo.datagen.scenario.ScenarioRunner.keyRegistrySnapshot(ScenarioRunner.kt:85)
  at com.gridgain.demo.datagen.cli.ScenarioRunnerCli.run(ScenarioRunnerCli.kt:445)
```

The measurement is **valid**; only the `scenario '<name>' complete: ... achieved_rate=...` line in
`run.log` is missing, because the process never reached it.

**Consequence for any harness:** a harvester that greps `run.log` for `complete:` reports this run as
having produced nothing, which reads exactly like a failed run. **Harvest from `result.yaml`**
(`<run-dir>/data-generator/runs/<run-id>/result.yaml`) — it carries `achieved_rate`, `error_count`,
`stop_reason` and the latency percentiles, and it is written before the snapshot step. Treat a run as
failed only when `result.yaml` is absent or its `stop_reason` is not what you asked for.

`KeyRegistry` growth tracks **total keys written** (throughput x duration), not concurrency, so a
write-heavy scenario reaches it sooner than a balanced one at the same rate. Raising the generator
heap defers it; it does not remove it.

## ⚠️ GG9 target: one client, and therefore one connection per node

`Gg9KvTarget` lazily opens a **single** `IgniteClient` per process and holds it for the run. The GG9
thin client opens one TCP channel per server address and its builder exposes no multiplexing knob —
`addresses`, `connectTimeout`, `addressFinder`, `backgroundReconnectInterval`, and nothing else. So a
process talking to a 2-node cluster has exactly 2 channels, each pinned to one Netty event loop at
each end.

Measured on the Power lab: those 2 client event loops ran at **81.5% and 73.8%** while 768 worker
threads sat at 5-7%, and on the server 2 of 128 `network-worker` threads ran at ~84% while 126 idled.

⚠️ **This is a latency finding, not a throughput one.** Running 8 processes instead of 2 (same total
operations in flight, 4x the connections) left throughput unchanged within noise — 73,708 vs 77,259 —
but **halved p99**, 12.43 ms to 6.55 ms, by spreading work over 8 server event loops instead of 2.
Do not reach for more processes expecting throughput; reach for them to even out the tail.


## Metrics

- **OTel instruments** (always recorded): in-flight, op duration histogram, errors, target rate, observed/achieved rate — tagged by scenario/target/schema/operation, where `target` is the **cluster name** from `--target-cluster` (see gotcha 12). Exported per the `otel:` block.
- **Live Kafka sink** (only when `metrics:` present): a JSON snapshot every `interval_ms` to the named topic. Fields (camelCase on the wire, see `metrics/MetricsSnapshot.kt`): `observedTps`, `avgLatencyMs`, `totalOps`, `errorCount`, `runAvgTps`, `runAvgLatencyMs`, `runLatencyHistogram`, `targetTps`, `runGroup`, `runId`, `active`. Consumers (e.g. a UI) subscribe for a live rate/latency feed without scraping Prometheus.
  - **`observedTps`/`avgLatencyMs` are interval figures; `runAvgTps`/`runAvgLatencyMs` are whole-run.** The first pair makes a live graph track current load; the second pair is what an end-of-run summary reports.
  - **`avgLatencyMs` is an interval *mean*, not a percentile.** No scalar percentiles are on this feed. What *is* on it is `runLatencyHistogram` — the instance's whole-run HdrHistogram, compressed encoding, base64, **microseconds** — which a consumer reads any percentile off. Sized by `histogram_highest_ms`/`histogram_significant_digits`; an operation slower than the ceiling is clamped to it, not dropped, so a p99 pinned at the ceiling reads as "slower than we can measure".
  - **Merge histograms, never average percentiles.** Percentiles do not compose: the max p90 across a fleet's instances is the worst instance's p90, not the fleet's. Decode each instance's histogram and `add()` them, then read the percentile off the merged result.
  - `scenario/LatencyHistogram.kt` is a *different* histogram, used only for stop conditions and exported nowhere — do not confuse the two. It was unbounded until v8 (it retained every sample, ~1.4 GB/hour at 50k ops/s, and worsened with rate); it is now an HdrHistogram and flat in memory. `errorCount` is cumulative, not a rate.
  - **`targetTps` tracks the current target**, so it follows a `ramped`/`stepped` schedule and any live override — not the run's start rate.
  - **Two ids.** `runId` is per *process*; each instance of a distributed run has its own, which is how a consumer counts live instances and expires a dead one. `runGroup` is shared by every instance launched together (`--run-group`) and is what a consumer aggregates and addresses by. **A launcher should supply the per-process one** (`--instance-id`, §CLI): self-minted, it is a string that appears nowhere the launcher can see, so "which instance is slow" has no answer.
  - **`shape`** (added with `--instance-id`) carries what this process is *able* to do: `concurrency`, and the `stripe` (`index`, `count`) it owns, or null when it owns the whole key space. Nested rather than two flat ints deliberately — a missing reference type fails deserialization, while a missing JVM primitive is silently filled with 0. A consumer sums `concurrency` across live instances for the fleet's in-flight operations (the only honest input to a throughput ceiling), and checks that the stripes *tile*: same `count` everywhere, indices exactly `0 until count`. A fleet whose slices overlap writes duplicate keys and every throughput figure it reports is meaningless.
  - Each instance emits a final `active=false` snapshot on clean stop, carrying its whole-run figures and final histogram. **SIGTERM is a clean stop** (gotcha 9), so a `dataGeneratorTeardown`, a deleted pod, a `systemctl stop` and an operator `stop` command all produce that snapshot — a consumer no longer has to supply run-summary figures *into* teardown, it can read them off the run's own last snapshot. A **SIGKILL** still emits nothing (grace period overrun, lost node, `kill -9`) — but because the histogram rides on *every* tick, the last tick received is still a usable summary. Consumers need their own staleness timeout regardless.
  - **Wire cost:** roughly 5–30 KB per instance per second at the recommended bounds, republished each tick because the histogram is cumulative. It grows with the spread of buckets touched and the variance in their counts, not with run length, so it plateaus. Well inside Kafka's 1 MB default `max.request.size`.

## Runtime control

Only when `control:` is present (v5+). The generator consumes `ControlCommand` JSON from the named topic and acts on it **without restarting** — this is how a UI drives load up and down, and stops a run, mid-flight. **Two kinds**, discriminated by a required `kind` field:

```json
{"kind": "set_rate", "runGroup": "20260809T101500Z", "targetTpsPerInstance": 250.0, "issuedAtMs": 1754731200000}
```

```json
{"kind": "stop", "runGroup": "20260809T101500Z", "issuedAtMs": 1754731200000}
```

- **`kind` is required, and there is no compatibility with the old flat message.** The pre-`kind` payload (`{runGroup, targetTpsPerInstance, issuedAtMs}` with no discriminator) is now rejected and logged, as is any unrecognised kind. **Every deployed generator archive and image must be redeployed** in the same pass as any sender that starts emitting the new shape — an old archive silently ignores `kind` (`set_rate` looks like an unknown field to it, so it reads as a rate command and still works) while a new archive silently ignores the old flat message, so a half-upgraded fleet responds to load commands but not to stop.
- **`set_rate`'s `targetTpsPerInstance` is per instance, not the fleet total.** An instance cannot know how many peers are live, so the sender divides. `0.0` pauses the instance — it stays connected and keeps reporting, so graphs flatline rather than vanish. A `0.0`-paused instance is **still stoppable**: a `stop` releases the paused pacing loop.
- **`stop` ends any run**, not only one declaring `external_signal` — it is an operator instruction, and refusing it for a `time`/`count` run would be surprising. It raises exactly the signal a SIGTERM does, so the instance finishes its in-flight operation and then emits its final `active=false` snapshot, closes its target and writes a real `result.yaml` (gotcha 9). A scenario declaring `external_signal` reports `stop_reason: external_signal raised: …`; any other run reports `stopped by signal: …`.
- An instance ignores commands whose `runGroup` is not its own, so one topic serves concurrent runs — including a `stop`, which never crosses runs.
- Every instance subscribes under a **unique consumer group**, so the topic broadcasts: one command reaches the whole fleet.
- A rate override outranks the scenario's `rate:` schedule; the configured constant/ramp/step runs untouched until the first command arrives.
- **Per-kind required fields, all checked before deserializing.** `set_rate` needs `runGroup`, `targetTpsPerInstance`, `issuedAtMs`; `stop` needs `runGroup`, `issuedAtMs`. A `set_rate` missing its rate is rejected rather than defaulted — Jackson would fill the `Double` with `0.0`, silently pausing the fleet.
- Nothing here is fatal: a malformed, undiscriminated, mis-addressed or unusable command is logged and skipped. Losing control must never take down a running load test.

## CLI

Launched via the generator's own CLI (entry points under `data-generator-gg8`/`-gg9`; dispatcher `ScenarioRunnerCli`). It takes the scenario name + paths to `ops.yaml`, `data.yaml`, the client-endpoints file, an output dir, **`--run-group <id>`** — the id shared by every instance of one logical run (see §Metrics) — and **`--target-cluster <name>` (required from ops v7)**, the cluster to write to, resolved against the client-endpoints file. All of those are required; a missing flag fails with a message naming it and the full expected invocation. **Verify the exact flag names against `ScenarioRunnerCli` / the `*Main` classes before scripting** — the config files above are the stable contract; launch flags are an implementation detail.

**Optional flags:**
- **`--broker-endpoints <path>`** — the `broker-endpoints.yaml` the demo toolkit writes when it deploys a `message_brokers` element (under `<demoOutputDirectory>/client/`). Needed only when a `metrics:`/`control:` block uses `broker: { kind: element, ... }`; a run using literal addresses, or one with no such blocks, does not need it. Deliberately **not required**: most demos have no message broker, and requiring it would break every existing invocation. The toolkit passes it automatically when the file exists.
- **`--otel-endpoint-override <url>`** — wins over `ops.otel.endpoint`, and promotes `exporter: NONE` to `OTLP` (passing an override only makes sense if exporting is wanted).
- **`--instance-id <id>`** — **this process's id, supplied instead of minted.** Absent → `RunId.generate()`, as before. It is the `runId` on every metrics snapshot (see §Metrics, "Two ids"), so whoever launched the process can find it again: the toolkit passes the systemd instance name on hosts and `$(POD_NAME)` on Kubernetes, and pairs it with `service.instance.id` in `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` so the Grafana series, the launcher's own record and the metrics feed are one string. Without it a launcher knew a process by one id and the process published another, and nothing joined them. A blank value is treated as absent rather than as an empty id.
- **`--instance-index <i> --instance-count <n>`** — **the key-space stripe for a multi-process run.** `n` is how many generator processes share the key space; `i` is the 0-based slice this one owns, and every `sequence` value source then strides by `n * step` from `start + i * step`. **Both or neither**, validated together: one without the other is refused naming both, as are a non-integer value, a count below 1, and an index outside `0..n-1`. Absent → this process owns the whole key space, exactly today's behaviour. **Refused** when the coordinator has already supplied a stripe (Kubernetes distributed mode) rather than one silently winning. **A multi-process host or local load test needs these** — see gotcha 11 for what happens without them, and note nothing checks that a fleet used each index exactly once.

**Why the cluster is a flag and not a config field.** The same load shape is routinely run against different clusters, and a scenario that named one made the whole ops file specific to a single demo. As a flag it is also checked before any load is generated: each `*Main` resolves the cluster up front and fails with a `MisconfigurationException` naming `--target-cluster` if the name is unknown or belongs to the other GridGain major version. That eager check matters — the resolution failure surfaces from inside the write path, where it is counted as an op error and discarded, so without it an unresolvable cluster produces a full-length run reporting zero successes and **exit code 0**.

## Replication (`backups`, `write_synchronization_mode`) — data v3

Per schema, and **only applied when the generator creates the cache** (`provisioning: emit|apply`):

```yaml
schemas:
  - name: customer
    backups: 1                            # copies beyond the primary; 0 = one copy, no redundancy
    write_synchronization_mode: full_sync # primary_sync | full_sync | full_async
```

- **`backups` alone does not make a put wait for its replica.** The default `primary_sync` returns
  as soon as the primary holds the row, so replication happens behind the call and none of its cost
  appears in the latency on the dashboard. `full_sync` is what makes the measurement mean what a
  reader assumes.
- **Reads stay local.** `readFromBackup` is GridGain's default (true) and is not exposed here: with
  `backups: 1` on two nodes every node holds every partition, so a read is answered wherever it
  lands. Measured on the Power lab: `put` 0.603 ms, `get` 0.229 ms — the asymmetry is the point.
- ⚠️ **A cache cannot be re-configured in place.** GG8 rejects `getOrCreateCache` against an
  existing cache with a different `backups`/`writeSynchronizationMode`/atomicity, so changing
  either value means **destroying the cache first**
  (`control.sh --host <bind-addr> --port 11211 --cache destroy --caches <name> --yes`; note
  `--host`, the connector binds the machine address, not loopback). `MigrateV2toV3` writes
  `backups: 0` / `primary_sync` into every pre-v3 schema, so upgrading changes nothing by itself.

## GridGain 9 (`Gg9Main`, `data-generator-gg9`)

Same two config files, same scenarios, same CLI. A separate archive rather than a flag, because the
GG8 and GG9 thin clients pull incompatible Ignite runtimes — the toolkit refuses to point a
generator at a cluster of the other major version, comparing the archive's
`gridgain_major_version` against the target cluster's.

**`ops.yaml` is already version-neutral.** Its v7 migration removed the `targets:` block, so the
cluster arrives as `--target-cluster` at launch and nothing in the file names a GridGain version.
The same ops file drives either flavour unchanged, which is what makes a like-for-like comparison
possible at all.

**`data.yaml` is not, and the difference is silent.** GG9 provisions with SQL rather than cache
configuration — `Gg9SqlDdlRenderer` emits one `CREATE ZONE` plus a `CREATE TABLE` per schema — so:

| data.yaml key | GG8 | GG9 |
|---|---|---|
| `backups` | cache `backups` | **ignored**; replication is a zone property |
| `write_synchronization_mode` | cache `writeSynchronizationMode` | **ignored**; no equivalent |
| `columns[].key` | cache key field | `PRIMARY KEY` |
| `columns[].affinity` | affinity key | appended to the PK, plus `COLOCATE BY` |

⚠️ **So the two flavours are not replica-for-replica equivalent on the same `data.yaml`.** GG8 with
`backups: 1` + `full_sync` holds two copies and makes the put wait for the second; the rendered GG9
zone carries **no `REPLICAS`** and takes the default of one copy, with no replica to wait for. A
throughput comparison across flavours must say so, or it is reporting the cost of replication as if
it were the difference between versions.

⚠️ **The rendered DDL hard-codes `STORAGE_PROFILES = 'default'`.** That is a *coupling to the
cluster's own configuration*: the profile named there must exist in the node's `ignite.storage.profiles`.
The toolkit's host GG9 template renders exactly one profile called `default`, so they agree — but a
hand-edited cluster configuration that renames it makes provisioning fail at `CREATE ZONE`, and the
error names the zone rather than the profile.

**No `--add-opens` in the GG9 launcher**, unlike GG8's: the GG9 thin client does not reflect on
`java.nio` internals. Gotcha 18's note about `setConnectionsPerServer` applies to `Gg8KvTarget`;
`Gg9KvTarget` builds its client from `DemoAddressFinder` the same way and likewise never sets it.

**Measured on the Power lab, 2026-09-23** — 2 processes x 64 threads on one LPAR against a two-node
GG9 cluster: **37,340 ops/s at 1.80 ms mean, 128 in flight, zero errors**. ⚠️ Not comparable with
the GG8 figures in the same lab: that cluster was uncapped at 64 vCPU/node with persistence off and
a 32 GiB region, while this one is CPU-capped to 32/node by its licence, uses `aipersist`, and has
an 8 GiB region — and the replica difference above. It is a "the path works" number, not a
version comparison.

## Throughput: resolve cache handles once

`Gg8KvTarget` used to call `IgniteClient.getOrCreateCache(name)` inside every `putRow` and every
`read`. On a **thin client that is a remote cache-lifecycle round trip**, not a local lookup, and
it sat inside the section each operation times and reports as its latency. Fixed 2026-09-20
(`CacheHandles`, one handle per schema, cleared when the client closes).

Measured on two Power11 LPARs, 2 generator processes, before -> after:

| threads/process | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | 51,301 ops/s @ 0.302 ms | 73,834 @ 0.198 ms |
| 16 | **70 @ 455 ms** | 122,481 @ 0.217 ms |
| 32 | **87 @ 732 ms** | 153,848 @ 0.259 ms |

Two lessons worth keeping. **Concurrency did not scale at all before it** — past ~16 operations in
flight throughput collapsed ~1,700x with both machines and the network idle, which reads exactly
like a cluster or network fault and is neither. And a standalone probe doing per-op
`getOrCreateCache` against a *single* cache showed only a 40% tax, not the collapse: the collapse
needs the generator's real shape, several schemas and several rows per event. **Do not model this
workload with one cache and one operation per iteration.**

✅ **Affinity awareness is now on** (`Gg8KvTarget.kt:91`). It defaults to **false** in
`ignite-core` 8.9.18, and while it was off every request from a process went to one node over one
connection and the rest of the cluster sat idle — so any figure recorded before it was turned on
was measuring a single server. The setter is `ClientConfiguration.setAffinityAwarenessEnabled`
there, not `setPartitionAwarenessEnabled`, which does not exist in that version.

`setConnectionsPerServer` is still never called, so the default applies — see gotcha 18.

- v10 capabilities: `config/OperationMix.kt`, `config/WarmupSpec.kt`, `config/KeySpaceSpec.kt`, `generation/KeySelector.kt`, `scenario/BoundedKeyResolver.kt`, `config/MigrateOpsV9toV10.kt`, `resources/schema/ops/v10.schema.json`
- run results: `scenario/ScenarioResult.kt` (`LatencySummary`, the `result.yaml` key list)
- graceful stop: `scenario/StopSignal.kt` (the one signal every stop source raises) + the shutdown hook and `GRACEFUL_STOP_SECONDS` in `cli/ScenarioRunnerCli.kt`
- runtime control: `control/` (`ControlCommand` — the sealed `set_rate`/`stop` hierarchy and its per-kind required fields — plus `ControlListener`, `KafkaControlListener`)
- stop conditions: `scenario/StopConditionEvaluator.kt`; the `external_signal`/`control:` rule is `ExternalSignalControlValidator` in `config/CrossElementValidator.kt`
- transaction/atomicity rule: `target/Gg8KvTarget.kt` (gg8 module)
- distribution/coordinator: `coordination/` package + the distribution validator
- metrics: `metrics/` — `MetricsSnapshot`, `LiveMetricsReporter`, `KafkaMetricsSink`, `LatencyHistogramBounds`, `HistogramCodec`. OTel instruments (a separate, always-on export) are under `observability/`.
- CLI: `cli/` package (`CliArgs` for the flag set and the `--instance-index`/`--instance-count` validation, `ScenarioRunnerCli` dispatcher + the `*Main` entry points, which is where the target cluster is resolved)
- key-space striping: `generation/SequenceValueSource.kt` (`PartitionStripe` + the stride arithmetic), `generation/ValueSourceFactory.kt` (where it reaches each sequence), `ScenarioRunnerCli.resolvePartitionStripe` (the coordinator-vs-flags precedence, which refuses both)
- broker references: `config/BrokerRef.kt` (the sealed `element`/`address` pair), `brokers/BrokerDirectory.kt` (`BrokerEndpointsSource`, the reader, `EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` — a deliberate duplicate of the plugin's writer constant), `config/MigrateOpsV8toV9.kt`, `schema/ops/v9.schema.json` (`$defs.broker_ref`)
- concurrency: `config/ScenarioSpec.kt` (`concurrency`), `generation/WorkerGenerators.kt` (per-worker generators + the max-cursor state merge), `generation/SequenceValueSource.kt` (`workerStripe` composition), `scenario/ScenarioRunner.kt` (`workerLoop`, first-stop-wins)
- target cluster: `config/TargetSpec.kt` — a sealed hierarchy still, but **no longer deserialized** from ops.yaml since v7; each `*Main` constructs the one variant it serves from `--target-cluster`

## Maintenance

This skill documents a moving target. **When you change the generator's config surface** — an ops/data schema field, a rate/value-source kind, `transaction_scope`/distribution semantics, the metrics or control block, or the CLI — **update this file in the same change and bump the *Last updated* date.** Prefer citing a source file over duplicating volatile detail. This rule is also recorded in this repo's `CLAUDE.md`.
